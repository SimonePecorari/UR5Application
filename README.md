# Robot UR5E: Simulation of Polishing on Sheet Metal

This simulation demonstrates the use of **force control** to perform uniform polishing on sheet metal with an irregular surface. A safety mechanism was implemented to prevent accidental impacts with the work area.

## üö® Safety Plane
A **safety plane** was defined at a height of `( ) [mm]` along the Z-negative axis with respect to the work plane. This ensures that the robot avoids any unintended collisions with the work area.

## üîß TOOL
A square-based parallelepiped was used to simulate the model of a polisher. The tool includes discretizations and a threaded shank at the center to allow the robot's gripper to securely grab it.

**Dimensions:**
- **Base:** 75 x 75 mm
- **Height:** 30 mm
- **Threaded Shank Height:** 40 mm

## üõ†Ô∏è SHEET METAL
The sheet metal surface includes irregularities that the robot must polish uniformly by applying force control.

**Dimensions:**
- **Length:** 1000 mm
- **Width:** 300 mm
- **Height:** 30 mm

## ‚öñÔ∏è PROCEDURE: Force Control
To simulate polishing uniformity that closely resembles industrial applications, the **MOVE_P** command was integrated into the force control system. This command maintains a constant tool speed during polishing.

### üîç Observations:
- **Low forces (1N and 3N):** The robot reversed the direction of force application.
- **High forces (10N):** Deformation of the sheet metal occurred.

Based on these results, a **force value of 8N** was selected as the optimal balance for uniform polishing.

> **Note:** Proper management of robot singularities is critical to ensure smooth operation and avoid errors.

## ‚è≥ LOOP END CONDITION
To properly manage the application's subprogram and allow the loop to terminate correctly, a **condition** was implemented. This condition evaluates as **TRUE** when the distance from the **START_POINT** to the acquired **REAL_TIME position** is maintained.
